# AI Weather App with React and OpenAI API

Welcome to the AI Weather App! This project demonstrates the integration of the OpenAI API with a React-based frontend to create an interactive weather application. The app allows users to input a country name and receive real-time temperature data along with weather conditions for that specific location. The AI component enhances user interaction by processing natural language queries and providing intuitive responses.
