AI Weather App with React and OpenAI API
Welcome to the AI Weather App! This project demonstrates the integration of the OpenAI API with a React-based frontend to create an interactive weather application. The app allows users to input a country name and receive real-time temperature data along with weather conditions for that specific location. The AI component enhances user interaction by processing natural language queries and providing intuitive responses.

Features
OpenAI API Integration: Understands natural language queries to fetch relevant weather data.
React-Based Frontend: Dynamic and responsive UI built using React.
User Authentication: Secure user-based authentication with tokens stored in a ServiceWorker.
Task-Based API Configuration: Efficient handling of specific user queries.
Interactive User Experience: Explains weather conditions in simple language and suggests appropriate attire based on the weather.
