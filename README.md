# AI Weather App with React and OpenAI API

Welcome to the AI Weather App! This project demonstrates the integration of the OpenAI API with a React-based frontend to create an interactive weather application. The app allows users to input a country name and receive real-time temperature data along with weather conditions for that specific location. The AI component enhances user interaction by processing natural language queries and providing intuitive responses.

## Features

- **OpenAI API Integration**: Understands natural language queries to fetch relevant weather data.
- **React-Based Frontend**: Dynamic and responsive UI built using React.
- **User Authentication**: Secure user-based authentication with tokens stored in a ServiceWorker.
- **Task-Based API Configuration**: Efficient handling of specific user queries.
- **Interactive User Experience**: Explains weather conditions in simple language and suggests appropriate attire based on the weather.
